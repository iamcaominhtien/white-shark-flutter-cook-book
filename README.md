# WHITE SHARK FLUTTER COOKBOOK

The white shark is my name :>, and this is the project that I have created with some designs that I love, such as the zoom drawer (based on the <a href = "https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_zoom_drawer">flutter_zoom_drawer</a> package), tinder cards design, or physics simulation. The code I wrote may not be fully optimized, but I am improving it daily. To see any design source code, click on the title.

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/animation_page_route">Animation page route</a>

True to its name, I explore applying animation effects to routing instead of traditional routing methods. These animations can be left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-down, and so on. When navigating to a new page using an animated page route, you can use gestures to close the page. For example, if the page opened with a left-to-right animation, closing the page would involve a right-to-left animation.</br>
Furthermore, I have also developed additional routing techniques for card detail animation. When clicking on a card detail, it gradually zooms in and displays more information (if available). Please watch the illustrated video for a clearer understanding.

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/tinder_cards">Tinder cards</a>
The design is based on the Tinder card style, where you "swipe right" to "match" and "swipe left" to "unmatch." The swiping effect is achieved using Transform techniques in Flutter.</br>

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/physic_simulation">Physic simulation</a>
The design is based on the guidance from the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/animation/physics-simulation">Flutter Cookbook</a>, but instead of using Align to position the DraggleCard, I utilize the Position and Stack widgets. I have made further improvements compared to the Flutter Cookbook example, allowing you to drag and drop the DraggleCard into any predefined area on the screen.</br>

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/zoom_drawer">Zoom drawer</a>
The design is based on the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_zoom_drawer">flutter_zoom_drawer</a> package available on pub.dev, but I did not use the source code from the package. Instead, I developed my own source code based on the core concepts of the GestureDetector widget and various Transform techniques in Flutter.</br>

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/wave_animation">Wave animation</a>
The design is inspired by the ripple effect on the water's surface, with a centre consisting of a circle or heart shape.</br>

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/excel_view">Excel view</a> <i>(Still a work in progress)</i>
The design is based on Google Sheets, and I am working on improving the performance when loading an Excel file with a large number of rows and columns.</br>

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/event_calendar">Events calendar</a> <i>(Still a work in progress)</i>
The design is inspired by a Facebook post I read, where the rows represent hours of the day, and the columns contain the names of people whose events you want to track throughout the day.</br>

## <a href="https://github.com/iamcaominhtien/white-shark-flutter-cook-book/tree/date_picker">Date picker</a>
The design is based on the Date Picker in Flutter. I encountered difficulties customizing the default Date Picker interface, so I decided to develop my own source code for it.</br>
